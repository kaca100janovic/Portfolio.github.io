        <h4>Test Engineer and Frontend Developer</h4>
        <p>
          I am a web developer and tester with a Bachelor's Degree in
          Information Technology from the Faculty of Information Technology. Due
          to my passion for photography, I have developed a keen eye for visuals
          and an innate sense of what is visually appealing. I utilize these
          skills in the creation of user-friendly interfaces. My creative side
          enables me to infuse digital designs with a sense of aesthetics,
          providing an added advantage for my clients. I am currently employed
          at Vega IT as a software tester, where my responsibilities involve
          ensuring the quality and functionality of software. Before my testing
          role, I worked as a Mendix developer for over a year on a commercial
          project, necessitating daily communication with team members and
          clients. Upon completing my degree, I freelanced and developed an
          application for a university. My work primarily focused on the
          front-end side of the application. During a four-month internship, I
          was introduced to software testing for the first time, gaining
          experience in manual testing. My ambition is to further advance my
          skills as a software tester. I am particularly keen on learning and
          implementing software automation techniques to streamline the testing
          process, ultimately enhancing the quality of software products.

              <h2>APPLICATION FOR TRANSFER OF STUDENTS FROM OTHER FACULTY</h2>
              <p>
                This application makes communication between University
                employees easier. The application's users are members of the
                commission and members of the marketing department. Marketing
                services create a new request, enter the student’s data, and
                finally forward it to the commission that decides about the
                status of the student and creates the curriculum for that
                student. The application allows users to view the request's
                status, which changes depending on the commission's decisions.
                The technical aspect of this application is automation,
                providing a good user interface and an overview of all potential
                students

              <h2>Application for policies</h2>
              <p>
                I work as a tester on an application designed for creating insurance
                 policies. This application generates policies tailored to each user's 
                 needs and preferences. Before the final version, a large number of 
                 employees must have access to these policies. In my role, I am 
                 responsible for creating manual test cases, which will soon be 
                 integrated with automation. By tracking all project requirements and 
                 staying aligned with the business goals, I help ensure that the 
                 application operates as intended. I meticulously document test scenarios 
                 for various aspects of policy creation, review, and editing. My work as
                  a QA tester involves a commitment to quality, careful planning, and 
                  thorough documentation, all of which are essential for delivering a
                   reliable application.

              <h2>BUSINESS TRAVEL PLATFORM</h2>
              <p>
                The project goal involved creating a new portal that provided
                companies with insights into their employees' travel data and
                allowed ease of travel-related payments. The platform also
                features a CO2 emissions tracking functionality. It is designed
                to handle heavy workloads, is easily maintainable, and can be
                expanded as needed. Each company has a branded design, and the
                portal was adapted for multiple countries, customizing language,
                currency, and documents. The front-end was developed using
                Mendix and CSS. The main goal of developing Mendix involves data
                retrieval from APIs and display through Mendix widgets.

              <h2>ORDER FOOD</h2>
              <p>
                The application serves as a platform for users and
                providers, offering a streamlined food ordering and management

                process. User Profiles: The application caters to two primary
                user groups: employees and food providers. Employees have
                individual profiles, granting them the ability to browse the
                menu and place orders. Provider Functions: Food providers, on
                the other hand, have more extensive privileges. They can add,
                modify, or remove food items from the menu, track daily orders
                placed by employees, and view comments and ratings left by
                users. This project requires rigorous testing to ensure a
                seamless user experience for both employees and providers. My
                role as a manual tester involves meticulously examining the
                application's functionality, assessing user interfaces, and
                verifying that all features, such as order placement, menu
                management, and user feedback, operate smoothly and effectively.
