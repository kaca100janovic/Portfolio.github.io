          Years of working on complex, high-risk systems have taught me one thing: the best results come from listening to users, to data, and to details. Whether I’m writing SQL queries, documenting bugs, or collaborating with business teams, I stay grounded in the belief that quality starts with understanding, not assumptions.

        <h4>Quality Assurance Engineer</h4>
        <p>
          With over three years of experience in software testing, primarily within the insurance and finance sectors, I have developed a strong ability to understand complex business processes and translate them into clear and effective test cases. Currently, I am working on a large-scale project in the insurance domain, where I prepare and execute manual test cases based on business requirements, document bugs, and perform regression and end-to-end testing. I also contribute to test automation using Playwright, helping to accelerate the testing process and improve the quality of delivered features.
          I have a solid understanding of the entire software testing lifecycle, from requirements analysis, test planning, and test case creation, to execution, bug tracking, validation, and final regression testing. I believe that a deep understanding of this process is essential for delivering high-quality software solutions.
          
          In my daily work, I closely collaborate with product owners, business analysts, and both frontend and backend developers, maintaining a clear grasp of technical concepts and ensuring effective communication across teams. I am experienced with tools such as Postman, Jira, GitHub, Cypress, and have a good understanding of HTTP protocols.
          
          I am analytical, proactive, and highly responsible. I work well independently, take initiative, and thrive in dynamic team environments. I am always focused on delivering precise and high-quality results, with a strong emphasis on user experience.

              <h2>Insurance Application</h2>
              <p>
                Technologies: Playwright, SQL, Azure DevOps
                I worked on a web application for an insurance company, which gave me hands-on experience in the insurance domain. My responsibilities included writing and executing manual test cases, identifying and documenting bugs, and creating automated end-to-end tests using Playwright. I also wrote SQL queries to validate that data was correctly populated across all relevant fields.
                
                Testing required a high level of precision and attention to detail, as the application serves multiple international markets, each with its own set of business rules. I used Azure DevOps for test management and tracking.
                
                In addition to testing activities, I was responsible for preparing and delivering presentations to both clients and internal business teams, showcasing new system functionalities and improvements. These sessions were held in English and involved translating technical updates into clear, user-focused demonstrations.

              <h2>Corporate Travel Management Portal</h2>
              <p>
                Technologies: Jira, Swagger, Manual Testing
The goal of this project was to build a new portal that provides companies with insights into their employees' travel data, allows streamlined travel-related payments, and includes CO2 emissions tracking features.
I was responsible for writing test plans and manual test cases, and for working with Swagger to understand and validate APIs. I also maintained detailed bug statistics — tracking where bugs occurred and which user segments were affected.
The project required close collaboration with business and marketing teams, as we frequently received client feedback and translated it into actionable improvements to enhance the user experience.

              <h2>ORDER FOOD</h2>
              <p>
                Technologies: Manual Testing, UI Validation, Bug Reporting
                The application is a food ordering and management platform designed for two user groups: employees and food providers. Employees can browse menus and place orders, while providers manage food items, track orders, and review user feedback.
                
                My role on this project involved writing and executing manual test cases, ensuring that core features such as order placement, menu updates, and feedback handling functioned as expected. I performed detailed UI validation, reported bugs, and collaborated with the team to continuously improve the user experience for both types of users.
